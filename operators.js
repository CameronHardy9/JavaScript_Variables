// JS Operators Exercise

//Exercise 1
let a = 20;
let b = 4;
let add = a + b;
let minus = a - b;
let multiply = a * b;
let dividing = a / b;

console.log(`${add}\n${minus}\n${multiply}\n${dividing}`)


//Exercise 2
let a = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Jackie";
let lastName = "Chan";

/*
What is the value of: a + str?  ANSWER = "1111"
What is the value of: a + str2? ANSWER = "11eleven"
What is the value of: a + isPresent? ANSWER = 12
What is the value of: a + firstName? ANSWER = "11Jackie"
What is the value of: a + lastName? ANSWER = "11Chan"
*/


//Exercise 3
let d = 5;
let str3 = "5";
let str4 = "five";
let isPresent2 = false;
let firstName2 = "Robin";
let lastName2 = "Williams";

/*
What is the value of: d == str3?  ANSWER = true
What is the value of: d === str3?  ANSWER = false
What is the value of: !isPresent2?  ANSWER = true
What is the value of: (“eleven” == str4 && d >= str3)?  ANSWER = false
What is the value of: (!isPresent2 || isPresent2)?  ANSWER = true
What is the value of: 0 == false?  ANSWER = true
What is the value of: 0 === false?  ANSWER = false
What is the value of: 0 != false?  ANSWER = false
What is the value of 0 !== false?  ANSWER = true
